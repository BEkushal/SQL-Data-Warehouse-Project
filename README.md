# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my version of the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀
This project is a guided learning experience built while following an incredible tutorial by a seasoned data professional on **YouTube**. The project showcases the process of building a data warehouse from scratch, implementing ETL pipelines, and deriving actionable insights — all with a hands-on, industry-relevant approach.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**- a structured approach using **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers to design scalable and maintainable data solutions.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Ingests raw data from CSV files into SQL Server (ERP and CRM datasets).
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleanses, standardizes, and transforms the data for quality and consistency.
3. **Gold Layer**: Refines the data into business-ready models (star schema) for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 What This Project Covers

This hands-on project is helping me learn and apply:

1. **Data Architecture Design** using the **Medallion approach**.
2. **ETL Pipeline** Creation to extract, transform, and load data using SQL.
3. **Data Modeling** with fact and dimension tables suitable for analytics.
4. **SQL-Based Analysis & Reporting** to extract actionable business insights.

🎯 This journey enhances my skills in:
- SQL Development
- Data Warehousing
- ETL Pipeline Design
- Dimensional Modeling
- Data Analytics
- Git & Project Documentation

## 🚀 Project Requirements (As I Understood & Applied Them)

### ✅ Data Engineering – Building the Warehouse

#### Goal:
Build a SQL Server-based data warehouse using ERP and CRM data to consolidate and analyze sales data enabling data driven decision making.

#### My Key Takeaways:
- **Data Source(s):** Imported and explored raw data from two systems (CSV format).
- **Data Quality:** Addressed data quality and performed necessary transformations.
- **Data Integration:** Created a clean analytical data model, combining both sources into one.
- **Scope:** Focused on the latest available dataset (no historization).
- **Documentation:** Documented the process for clarity and reproducibility.

### 📊 BI & Analytics – Making Sense of the Data

#### Goal:
Develop SQL scripts to uncover insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product-level Performance**
- **Sales Trends and KPIs**

The end goal is to support data-driven decisions through clear, focused reporting.
